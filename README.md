# The Entities Researcher

## Developed with the MERN stack

### Introduction

We built a full stack - application and deployed it to Heroku at \***\*\*\*\*\*** that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on user demand:

- Using React for the front end.
- Using REST-API with a Node.js and Express.js server.
- Using SQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
- Using FETCH, POST, PUT etc. for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- Deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Offering a polished UI, is responsive and is interactive
- The project has a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.) and a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
